========
Overview
========

Mezzanine is a content management platform built using the `Django`_ 
framework. It is `BSD licensed`_ and designed to provide both a consistent 
interface for managing content, and a simple architecture that makes diving 
in and hacking on the code as easy as possible.

Its goal is to resemble something like `Wordpress`_, with an intuitive 
interface for managing pages and blog posts. Mezzanine takes a different 
approach from other Django applications in this space like `Pinax`_ or 
`Mingus`_ that glue together a lot of reusable apps, instead opting to 
provide most of its functionality included with the project by default.

ORM, templating, caching and the automatic admin interface, Mezzanine 
provides the following features.

Dependencies
============

Mezzanine has no explicit dependencies apart from a standard Django 
environment using.

  * `Python`_ 2.5 ... 2.7
  * `Django`_ 1.1 ... 1.3
  
Mezzanine is designed however to be used most effectively in conjunction 
with the following libraries.

  * `setuptools`_
  * `Python Imaging Library`_ (PIL)
  * `django-grappelli`_ <= 2.0
  * `django-filebrowser`_ <= 3.0
  
Browser Support
===============

Mezzanine's admin interface works with all modern browsers. 
Internet Explorer 7 and earlier are generally unsupported.

Installation
============

Assuming you have `setuptools`_ installed, the easiest method is to install 
directly from pypi by running the following command, which will also attempt 
to install the dependencies mentioned above::

    $ easy_install -U mezzanine

Otherwise you can download Mezzanine and install it directly from source::

    $ python setup.py install
    
Once installed, the command ``mezzanine-project`` should be available which 
can be used for creating a new Mezzanine project in a similar fashion to 
``django-admin.py``::

    $ mezzanine-project project_name

You can then run your project with the usual Django steps::

    $ cd project_name
    $ python manage.py syncdb --noinput
    $ python manage.py runserver
    
You should then be able to browse to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log 
in using the default account (``username: admin, password: default``). If 
you'd like to specify a different username and password during set up, simply 
exclude the ``--noinput`` option included above when running ``syncdb``.

Contributing
============

Mezzanine is an open source project that is managed using both Git and 
Mercurial version control systems. These repositories are hosted on both 
`Github`_ and `Bitbucket`_ respectively, so contributing is as easy as 
forking the project on either of these sites and committing back your 
enhancements.
